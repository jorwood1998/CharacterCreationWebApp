# Character Creator
## Team Earth Kingdom's Agile Project



- Create a WEB.API using Visual Studio
- Use Agile practices

## Features

- Create a database with characters, teams, and attributes tables
- Use Visual Studio to create classes and controllers
- Use GitHub to push, pull, and merge data amongst the team members
- Use Agile practices to divy, point, and track duties as well as User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, and Sprint plans
- Use Trello to track above-mentioned Agile practices

The goal of our app is to allow users to create their own character.
The user will be able to choose a name for their character, as well as choose
physical attributes. If they so choose, they can also allow the app to
randomly create a character for them. We also hope to allow the user to 
export their character for outside uses.
